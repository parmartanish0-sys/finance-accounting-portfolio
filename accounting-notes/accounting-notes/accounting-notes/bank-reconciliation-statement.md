## What is a Bank Reconciliation Statement?

A Bank Reconciliation Statement (BRS) is prepared to reconcile the
difference between:

- Bank balance as per Cash Book

These balances often differ due to timing and recording differences.

in the bank statement, and vice versa.

### 2. Cheques Deposited but Not Cleared
Cheques deposited but not yet credited by the bank.

---

### 5. Interest Credited by Bank
